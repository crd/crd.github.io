I'm a big fan of plaintext -- it's portable, searchable, and there's no risk of vendor lock-in -- and Markdown has been my preferred note-taking markup language for years. I've historically relied on a filesystem-based hierarchical organizational mechanism which was adequate but not spectacular. Recently I came across [Logseq][logseq-site] and was delighted to see it checked all the boxes:

- opensource
- locally-hosted
- plaintext
